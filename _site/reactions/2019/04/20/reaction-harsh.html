    <p>Coming into the class, I do not have much first hand experience with the “cogs” of the current United States healthcare ecosystem and the history that shaped and continues to shape its evolution. I know of some of the players that were involved, such as patients, providers, insurance companies, EHR vendors, hospitals, labs, researchers, and the government, but I would like to better understand how the different workflows interact and how information is exchanged. By knowing this, I think I will be better able to provide input on how and what changes should be considered to better the system.</p>

<p>With that in mind and in order to begin digging deeper into such a complex mess of interactions, I selected reading about “Healthcare Access”, chapters 3 and 13 of the “Understanding Health Policy: A Clinical Approach” textbook by Bodenheimer and Grumbach. The book itself was pretty well written, with examples from hypothetical patients interspersed with statistics and findings from recent studies and legislation. The text was easy to read and the figures provided added color to the commentary. I may, if time permits, read the other chapters that my team members were assigned simply because the book is a good resource.</p>

<p>I find the concept of writing a primer for the next class of biomedical informaticians very interesting. I think it will both help summarize the topics discussed in class for me and train me in writing complex issues in a way that is easy for others to understand, a very useful skill in my opinion. The lack of a strict rubric and structure is also nice because it allows us to be a bit creative in how we create this primer. This could lead to some challenges in the future, but so far, we have not run into any major hiccups. We decided to go with a blog-style primer, hosted on a Github Pages repository so that everyone can contribute easily and we can track the changes made. We did decide to use an existing free-for-use HTML and CSS template (with credit given to the creators of course), and I think this was a nice balance between using a web hosting site like Weebly or WordPress and creating a new website from scratch.</p>

<p>I look forward to seeing how our primer will evolve in the future. We have some ideas about doing videos and podcasts for some of the chapters, and I think they will be a great break from the text descriptions.</p>
