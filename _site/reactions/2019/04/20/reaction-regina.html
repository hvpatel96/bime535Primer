<meta name="description" content="Understanding how the US Healthcare system works has been more complicated of what I expected. The fact that many players are involved and that all of them have a hard time improving the provided healthcare made me think how feasible it is to change the US healthcare system. Coming from a middle-income country, I thought that the system would work flawlessly and that the patient will have always the best quality care but reading the chapters related to the quality of care that patients are receiving reminds me of all the disparities I saw back home where only the rich and famous were guarantee of getting the best doctors with the best treatments and medications. I don’t believe any country has a ‘perfect healthcare system’ because we can always improve but I think that for improving we need to start having a public health perspective where prevention is key and we need to stop seeing healthcare only as a revenue where people are making profits out of other people sickness and ill-being. This means not only thinking healthcare for the individual patient but seeing a whole community as the patient." />
