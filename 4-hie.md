# What is Health Information Exchange and what are the current technologies and implementations?
Health Information Exchange (HIE) is the idea that healthcare providers and other entities in need of health information are able to exchange this information. Players might include clinics, hospitals, patients, labs, public health agencies, researchers, schools, and many others. These entities might exchange information about patients for various reasons, e.g. to enable continuous healthcare delivery for the patients seeing providers at different clinics, to conduct public health surveillance and monitor intervention effectiveness, or to conduct data analytics for research or quality improvement purposes.

There are several types of Health Information Exchange(“What is HIE? \| HealthIT.gov,” n.d.): **Directed exchange** involves providers and other entities who wish to exchange information sending information directly to each other over the internet, through channels such as secure/encrypted email or other messaging services. This type of exchange requires the exchange partners to have an established relationship (i.e. they know and trust each other). Direct exchange is utilized to exchange immunization information with public health agencies. In **query-based exchange**, healthcare providers (or other entities) request or search for a particular piece of information (which may be a whole record). Query-based exchange is often used for emergency care. **Consumer-mediated exchange** is a third type of HIE, where patients communicate their own data to other entities, e.g. they might share step data from a personal device with a healthcare provider. Consumers may also access and correct their own health information as part of consumer-mediated exchange.

An example of a query-based exchange service is Surescipts(“Surescripts \| The Nation’s Most Trusted Health Information Network,” n.d.). Surescripts maintains an electronic database of drug prescriptions which is automatically updated whenever a healthcare provider utilizes “e-prescribing”. Healthcare organizations are responsible for enabling the  e-prescribing functionality in the EHRs, which ensures that data is continually sent to the Surescripts databases. Pharmacies and other providers then query this Health Information Exchange system for their patients’ prescription information.


# What is the current state of HIE adoption?

Since the passing of the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act in 2009, a lot of attention has been given to accelerating the adoption of health information technology. HITECH’s goals are promoting the adoption and use of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) and Health Information Exchange (HIE) for improving costs and quality of the US health care delivery system by modernizing it. Following that Act, between 2009 and 2014, the percentage of hospitals adopting basic EHR grew from 12.2% to 75.5% (Mackert, Mabry-Flynn, Champlin, Donovan, & Pounders, 2016).
 
In 2014, (Adler-Milstein & Jha, 2014) reported that in the U.S. there is a large state-to-state variation of HIE adoption and that the for-profit hospitals were far less likely to engage in HIE than non-profit hospitals. For this, states receive funding for the development and implementation of strategies in where every provider would access clinical data in at least one way and for ensuring that key clinical data can flow across providers and services. The same year, (Furukawa et al., 2014) found that, although office-based physicians had a high-rate of EHR adoption, the HIE was considerably limited to providers within the same organization. After that, (Devine et al., 2017) reported that HIE in 2015 had risen substantially over-time, with 82% of non-federal hospitals exchanging information (2015), 38% of physician practices (2013) and 17% of long-term care facilities (2013). By 2017, (Johnson, Pylypchuk, & Patel, 2017) with the ONC reported that about 70% of acute care hospitals participated in at least one HIE network with US nationwide scope. According to (Sadoughi, Nasiri, & Ahmadi, 2018) 68.75% of hospital EDs participate in HIE, 53.13% of hospitals, 46.88% of outpatient hospitals, 37.5% of clinics, 31.25% of medical centers and 25% of physician offices. The same study shows that the individuals that participate in HIE were mostly physicians, radiologist, laboratories, pharmacies, clinical staffs, and nurse practitioners.
 
*Potential issues in the HIE adoption and implementation (Ji, Yoo, Heo, Hwang, & Kim, 2017)*
 
A variety of issues has been reported for improving the adoption of HIE systems. These problems can be separated into 4 major categories: Usability, Documents and Data Elements, System Architecture and Standards, and HIE Consent. The first category relates to system speed, real-time responses, proper usability of the system and disruption of providers workflow. The document and data item category relate to the problems of the ‘exchange document’ that will include relevant clinical data and the standards needed for the creation of such document. The third category, Architecture, and standards relates to documentation issues for the architectural standards that will support HIE among providers. The last category, Consent, is about the problems in the consent forms needed for the exchange of clinical information. All of those issues can be solved with enhancing policy support from the government that will allow a smaller healthcare organization to transition for using HIE even if they do not use market-leading EHRs or are not members of a large integrated health system (Everson & Cross, 2019).
