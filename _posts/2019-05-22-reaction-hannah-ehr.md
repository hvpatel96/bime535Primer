Reading about and discussing electronic health record systems is always a little disillusioning for me. When I first learned about EHRs, I thought they were wonderful and would improve our lives tremendously. Digitizing our healthcare data would bring so much potential! Realizing that many health care professionals don't particularly like them is disappointing. Reflecting on this, I realized that my fascination with and excitement about EHRs is not in small part motivated by my general excitement about technology. However, doctors and nurses aren't (necessarily) techies who are excited about technology for technology's sake - and rightly so, because they have important work to do, and they cannot be expected to find the time and energy to deal with any new tool unless it can demonstrate that it is useful. The _idea_ of doing exciting things is not enough to convince everyone of the benefits of EHRs. Furthermore, users have different levels of experience with computers (e.g. some may not be skilled at typing on a keyboard yet, while others may use computers and smart phones every day already); plus, learning new technology tools comes more easily to some than others. As a result, the demonstrated benefits may have to be very high, even impossibly so, to convince some potential users to adopt EHR systems. 

Thinking about the opportunities and barriers to realizing the full potential of EHRs from different perspectives was eye opening: the healthcare provider perspective, the business perspective, the patient perspective, and the informaticist's perspective. However, as with the previous chapter, we found it difficult to zero in on what's most important. Inspired by our own experiences in trying to understand why not everybody loves EHRs, we focused this chapter on benefits vs. tradeoffs, stakeholder conflicts, and the difficulties inherent in changing any well established system or process.
