Health Information Exchange seems to be frustratingly difficult to implement. However, what struck me in reading about HIE is that e-prescribing through networks such as Surescripts is surprisingly wide-spread. According to the 2014 ONC report on E-prescribing ("E-Prescribing Trends in the United States"), some states, such as Minnesota, have achieved 100% (!) of prescriptions being entered into health information exchanges through e-prescribing. Why does it work so well for prescriptions, and why can't we achieve such remarkable adoption rates for other information? 

My suspicion is that it has to do with the business incentives behind exchanging prescription information. There are many retail pharamcies who benefit tremendously from being able to easily access prescription information, transferring prescriptions, and marking medications as dispensed. In fact, without having the prescriptions, these retail pharamcies would not be able to make sales. Similar business incentives do not exist for the exchange of other types of information, such as lab tests and radiology - in fact, the incentives are opposite in some cases. For example, duplicate lab tests or imaging studies only make sense in the absence of the previous results. Thus, the sale can only be made if the information is _not_ exchanged. While we'd like to think that hospitals and clinics are not out for profit like commercial retailers like CVS and Walgreens, healthcare organizations still need to maintain their bottom line in order to stay in business - plus, there are many hospitals and clinics that actually are for-profit organizations. 

Therefore, an essential yet tremendously difficult problem to address is how to find the right balance of regulation and business incentives to enable health information exchange.
