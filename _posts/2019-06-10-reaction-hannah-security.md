With the ubiquitous digitization of health data today, the risk of compromising the privacy and confidentiality of protected health informatinion is unprecedented. Common communication channels, such as email, are not sufficiently secure to allow transmission of patient information. A hard drive the physical size and weight of a single paper chart can hold millions of patient records now, which means that a single person carrying such information on a laptop or other device may inadvertently compromise all that information if the device is lost of stolen. But even if laptops are properly encrypted and never let out of sight, servers can get hacked. In 2015, almost 79 million (!) individuals were affected in a data breach at Anthem as a result of a hacking incident that was made possible by one or more employees falling for a spear phishing email (HHS 2019). 
Yet, we must share PHI in order to harness its potential to improve medicine. But even if information is only shared in compliance with de-identification regulations and best practices, it has been shown that it can still be re-identified in some cases. In the face of all this adversity, I sometimes feel that we will never be able to harness the full potential of our vast health data stores because of privacy concerns. For the chapter on security, I found it especially inspiring to read about medGAN and related technologies, which may make it possible in the future to circumvent the need to share data altogether. While I am not sure to what degree data is truly anonymous if it accurately reflects real people, or to what degree it is truly accurate if it is completely anonymous, I am interested to see where this line of inquiry takes us.
