title:  "Could enhancing the non-human elements of healthcare actually enhance the human elements of healthcare?"

I find it difficult to completely separate the fields of clinical decision support and artificial intelligence, given that CDS is essentially just one of the practical implementations of AI in healthcare. Although healthcare AI has become something of a hot topic over the past few decades, I continue to view this burgeoning field with more than a hint of skepticism. I do think that AI has several current use cases in healthcare that can be implemented with relatively high confidence at the moment (i.e. radiology and pathology imaging support, passive patient monitoring, and early warning systems), and they have already proven to be genuine assets to the healthcare delivery process. However, any AI interventions that seek to actually mimic patient-provider interactions do not seem like useful or humane endeavors to me. I have learned time and time again that the patient-provider relationship is one of the most important aspects of the care process, and it would be an absolute shame to see that taken away completely. It seems like we have already observed some of the detrimental effects of losing the patient-provider connection, as consultation times have gotten shorter and as doctors are required to spend more time fiddling with their computers during visits than making eye contact with patients. It is my hope that AI interventions will help free up time for providers to reestablish their roles as trustful caregivers for patients, rather than replacing the human interaction component of healthcare even further.
