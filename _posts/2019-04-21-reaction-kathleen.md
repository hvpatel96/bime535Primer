I have experienced the US healthcare system firsthand for 20+ years and have obliquely learned about healthcare structure and financing through conversations with family/friends and via classes I have taken in the past, but these last few weeks have made me realize how little I actually know about this system. I admittedly come from a priveleged background, and the vast majority of my experiences with the healthcare system have been positive and have kept me healthy. There were a few near misses tossed in there, but I have generally viewed those as isolated errors, rather than symptoms of a deeply flawed system. I have since changed my mind.   

While reading though the Bodenheimer and Grumbach text--which I believe describes a very complex system with admirable consision--I felt gripped by the material in the same way I might be drawn in to a mystery novel, or possibly a well-done horror movie. Ok, maybe I'm exaggerating...but I am frightened by the current state of the US healthcare system, and I truly wish there were some relatively straightforward policy changes and/or informatics interventions that could make a positive difference in the everyday experience of patients and providers. But the book makes a very convincing argument that the historical conditions that led to the existing state of healthcare have also left us in a very precarious situation with no strighforward way out.

I visualize the US healthcare system as an enormous game of Jenga, i.e. that game where all those wooden blocks are stacked up on each other and you try not to let the whole thing fall apart as you take block away one-by-one. Imagine that those different blocks are things like the fee-for-service payment system, big pharmacy companies, small private practices, healthcare tech vendors, academic researchers, the NIH, CMS, etc. The entire patchwork of subsystems and stakeholders in this game make removing some of the more troublesome elements of the system very difficult. If we removed fee-for-service payment, for example, imagine how many other elements of the system would be thrown out of whack and how many stakeholders would rebel. I, for one, think that the system must be completely rebuilt from the ground up in order for real positive change to be achieved, but I have absolutely no idea how that would work and I don't think that would be the most popular idea on the block.

While reading the B&G text, I also had some strange flashbacks to a book that my third grade teacher read to our class long ago (can you tell that I like allegories?). In this book, *Maniac Magee*, the main character is great at untying knots for some reason. He encounters a famous knot, called the "Cobble's Knot," that is unlike any knot he has ever seen. I'll just end with a few "direct" quotes from the book:


> > [The US healthcare system] "had more contortions, ins and outs, twists and turns, and dips and doodles than the brain of Albert Einstein himself."

> > "If the Wonders of the World hadn't stopped at seven, [the US healthcare system] would have been number eight."
