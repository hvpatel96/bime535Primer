                <p class="c2"><span class="c4">Health care in the United States is more expensive than in any other Western nation; yet, patient outcomes do not reflect the investment. Understanding the reasons behind the astronomical health care costs and the disappointing outcomes in this country is an important pre-requisite to understanding what can be done about it. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="c2"><span class="c4">Two important contributors to the explosion of costs in the U.S. healthcare system today are (1) the current health insurance system and (2) the current payment model by which healthcare providers are compensated. However, there are many more. </span>
                </p><h5 class="c6" id="h.iz5oy664es4r"><span class="c1">Health insurance: Community rating vs. Experience rating</span>
            </h5>
                <p class="c2"><span class="c4">Health insurance is unlike other insurance in that it is expected to cover most or all healthcare expenses, including routine and preventive care. Health insurance policies are therefore also often called health plans.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="c2"><span class="c4">The principle of the redistribution of funds is fundamental to how health insurance works: everyone pays a regular contribution, and those that get sick then benefit regardless of the sum of money they have contributed. Because only some will get sick in a given month or year, the collectively contributed money can cover all costs for the few that need payouts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="c2"><span>Premiums can be set through either experience rating or community rating. </span><span
                        class="c0">Community rating</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;involves setting premiums to a fixed amount for everyone in a given community. Because everyone pays the same premium, this means that some people (e.g. the elderly or very sick) may receive benefits in excess of their contributions, whereas others (e.g. the young or generally healthy) may contribute more than they receive in benefits. This also means that individuals, even the very sick, are not left behind, but rather covered by society at large.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="c2"><span>The alternative is </span><span
                        class="c0">experience rating</span><span class="c4">, where premiums are set based on the expected typical needs for healthcare services and products, calculated from past usage (&ldquo;experience&rdquo;) for similar patients. Under this system, young and healthy individuals pay low fees, and old and sick people pay high fees. In a free market, insurers may choose to set premiums via experience rating, because this allows them to offer lower, more competitive premiums - as long as they control the amount of benefits paid out by avoiding the costliest patients. Those who are likely to have high healthcare needs will therefore have exceedingly high insurance premiums or will be altogether ineligible for insurance coverage.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="c2"><span class="c4">In the U.S., Blue Shield/Blue Cross used community rating, which allowed these insurers to cover individuals at a fixed premium that was not dependent on healthcare needs. However, with the advent of for-profit insurance companies, the younger and healthier individuals flocked towards these cheaper plans, leaving the community rating insurers with only the high-cost patients &ndash; an unsustainable situation. Today, experience rating is the most commonly used pricing system for individual insurance, which many poor and/or sick people depend on, e.g. the unemployed or those with jobs without health insurance benefits. This contributes to health insurance being much more expensive, to the point of being completely unaffordable, for those who are most in need of health care. While the Affordable Care Act included regulations that disallow insurers from systematically excluding certain groups &ndash; e.g. those with pre-existing conditions &ndash; insurers are still free to set premiums as they see fit, which means that they can charge the sickest patient populations with exorbitant premiums. An inequality of access to healthcare services is created, which contributed to poor outcomes for certain populations.</span>
                </p><h5 class="c6" id="h.1cbwlxb8ylkh"><span class="c1">Paying for healthcare: Fee-for-service vs. Capitation and Salary</span>
            </h5>
                <p class="c2"><span class="c4">One of the most important contributors to rising healthcare costs is the fee-for-service financing structure that is used in most healthcare settings in the U.S. today. Under this model, physicians are compensated for each individual service they perform (e.g. tests, procedures, and visits). This creates an economic incentive for doctors to perform more services. Unfortunately, this sometimes leads to unnecessary tests and procedures being performed. For example, if a doctor is paid for each surgery they perform, they may choose to perform many more surgeries that are not strictly necessary than they otherwise would.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="c2"><span class="c4">An alternative is the Capitation payment system, under which providers are paid a fixed amount of money for each patient in their care. Providers then have an incentive to provide the most effective care &ndash; to provide preventive care, take an active role in public health considerations (such as smoking cessation programs), and to only perform the most effective services. In other words, the doctor&rsquo;s responsibility is shifted from providing as much care as possible to keeping the patient healthy, and if they get sick, to treat them in the most economical way. In the U.S. today, capitation is practiced by some physician groups, such as Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs).</span>
                </p>
                <p class="c2"><span class="c4">Finally, an additional possible alternative is to pay physicians by salary. With this approach, physicians are freed entirely from concerns around their own compensation. While this removes the incentive to perform unnecessary services, the fact that there is also no significant incentive to perform the highest quality care is a possible concern. As a result, salaried physicians may often earn additional bonuses for high performance. </span>

                <p class="c2"><span class="c4">While the reasons why our healthcare system in the United States today is subpar, both in terms of outcomes and affordability and access, are manifold and complex, we can look to other countries and compare their systems to ours to find a possible path forward.</span>

                <p class="c2"><span class="c4">Community rating is used to set premiums by many western countries, such as Japan, Canada, the UK, and Germany. In fact, these countries not only set premiums independently of healthcare needs, but they also scale contributions based on income. For example, in both Canada and the UK, healthcare is entirely funded by taxes, which are set as a percentage of income. In Germany and Japan, a percentage of each individual&rsquo;s salary is deducted for health insurance (8.2% and 4.1%, respectively) with an additional contribution made by the employer.</span>

                <p class="c2"><span>Capitation is also used by several countries. For example, Canada has been shifting its payment model towards Capitation for many years, though much of reimbursement is still done on a fee-for-service basis.

                </p>
                <p class="c2 c15"><span class="c4"></span></p>
                <p class="c16"><span class="c4">Informatics interventions have been already made with the thought that it would improve quality in different aspects but it has had some mix results over time. At first, the EHR was thought to be the savior of the health care systems but it has complicated workflows for care providers that know has to worry about filling the electronic forms, which they didn&rsquo;t have to do before. This brings unsatisfaction and change resistance over the implementation of new electronic systems.</span>

                <p class="c2"><span class="c4">Prevention is key for improving quality. Without prevention and specific campaigns for attacking one of the possible sources for different diseases, quality will not be able to improve because care providers will have limited options on how to proceed with some specific disease. Focusing on social determinants of health is also important because it is tightly connected with prevention and how the public health campaigns are designed and implemented. We cannot longer have differences in treatment because on someone social or economic status, making them &lsquo;destined&rsquo; to have some specific type of care regardless of their health condition.</span>

                <p class="c2"><span class="c4">The book describes financial and non-financial barriers to care. Are one or both of these amenable to informatics interventions?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="c2"><span class="c4">Financial barriers to care primarily include lack of insurance or underinsurance, whereas non-financial barriers to care can include anything from lack of prompt access to language, literacy, and cultural differences to factors such as gender and race biases. Historically, large interventions (nationwide and sponsored by the government) have focused primarily to addressing the financial barriers to care. Landscape changing legislation like the Affordable Care Act along with existing programs such as Medicaid and Medicare are the major examples of tackling the uninsured population&rsquo;s inability to pay. While politicians, economists, and researchers still debate whether availability of insurance plays a large factor in more efficient diagnosis and resolution, there is no doubt that health insurance improves health outcomes in underserved populations and relieves financial loads that overwise accumulate over lifetimes. Also under financial barriers to care is underinsurance. Very few American adults and their families have good, quality health insurance compared to the masses and the rest of the world. It was reported in 2007 that roughly 62% of all bankruptcies in the US were caused by the inability to pay medical bills (Himmelstein et al., 2009). Simply having insurance is often not enough to receive the care one needs, especially for chronic diseases and pre-existing conditions. A good quote on this topic is quite simply: &ldquo;Access to health care does not guarantee good health, but without such access, health is certain to suffer.&rdquo; (Bodenheimer and Crumbach, 2016).</span>
                </p>
                <p class="c2"><span class="c4">Moving on to the non-financial barriers to care, recently, as the field of informatics and related disciplines move to a more active view on healthcare and place more attention on the patients, we have begun to uncover challenges that were not as closely studied in the past. These challenges include lack of prompt care, language and cultural differences between providers and their patients, and the influence of race/ethnicity and gender in the quality of care. Compared to the financial barriers of care, these factors have been understudied and amenable to informatics interventions. Studies on race, gender, age, and socioeconomic status with respect to healthcare access and outcomes have shown disparities in care, especially affecting the African American and Hispanic populations. Whether these were fueled by the availability of shareable electronic data or recent equality movements, it is clear to see that more work needs to be done to fully understand the cogs of this complex challenge so ingrained in our healthcare system. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="c2"><span class="c4">Specific examples of informatics interventions that can tackle both financial and non-financial barriers to care include better book-keeping and easier sharing of claims and health outcomes data. With electronic medical records, we are better able to understand the implicit workflows that govern the healthcare system and design ways to optimize and improve these workflows to better serve the patients. Interventions that could possibly improve non-financial barriers could include automated translation of languages and alerts reminding the providers to cover patient-specific needs (especially for gender and cultural biases). Lastly, an intervention that could help reduce the load of financial barriers may be as simple as tracking cost of care of chronic diseases of insured populations with different levels of coverage and analyzing whether overall cost per patient is minimized if better coverage is provided from the beginning.</span>

                <p class="c2"><span>In the face of the deteriorating primary care system in the US and rising healthcare costs, new models of care have been proposed to improve patient experience and outcomes. </span><span
                        class="c0">Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) </span><span class="c4">were formed as a result of the Affordable Care Act, which encouraged providers to voluntarily join together to form networks that manage all aspects of care for a given population. These groups are paid through payment models such as the Medicare Shared Savings Program, which incentivizes providers to reduce health care spending with a net savings bonus. The shared financial risk between payers and providers encourages a regionalized model of care and is meant to reduce healthcare costs.</span>

This proposed model would likely function in a &ldquo;medical neighborhood&rdquo; that resembles existing ACO structures. However, the practical implications of creating a personalized, integrated care experience for patients within a dispersed provider network are cause for concern in terms of achieving true healthcare reform.

I know of some of the players that were involved, such as patients, providers, insurance companies, EHR vendors, hospitals, labs, researchers, and the government, but I would like to better understand how the different workflows interact and how information is exchanged. By knowing this, I think I will be better able to provide input on how and what changes should be considered to better the system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="c2"><span class="c4">With that in mind and in order to begin digging deeper into such a complex mess of interactions, I selected reading about &ldquo;Healthcare Access&rdquo;, chapters 3 and 13 of the &ldquo;Understanding Health Policy: A Clinical Approach&rdquo; textbook by Bodenheimer and Grumbach. The book itself was pretty well written, with examples from hypothetical patients interspersed with statistics and findings from recent studies and legislation. The text was easy to read and the figures provided added color to the commentary. I may, if time permits, read the other chapters that my team members were assigned simply because the book is a good resource.</span>

I think it will both help summarize the topics discussed in class for me and train me in writing complex issues in a way that is easy for others to understand, a very useful skill in my opinion. The lack of a strict rubric and structure is also nice because it allows us to be a bit creative in how we create this primer. This could lead to some challenges in the future, but so far, we have not run into any major hiccups. We decided to go with a blog-style primer, hosted on a Github Pages repository so that everyone can contribute easily and we can track the changes made. We did decide to use an existing free-for-use HTML and CSS template (with credit given to the creators of course), and I think this was a nice balance between using a web hosting site like Weebly or WordPress and creating a new website from scratch.</span>

                <p class="c2"><span class="c4">I look forward to seeing how our primer will evolve in the future. We have some ideas about doing videos and podcasts for some of the chapters, and I think they will be a great break from the text descriptions. </span>

The fact that many players are involved and that all of them have a hard time improving the provided healthcare made me think how feasible it is to change the US healthcare system. Coming from a middle-income country, I thought that the system would work flawlessly and that the patient will have always the best quality care but reading the chapters related to the quality of care that patients are receiving reminds me of all the disparities I saw back home where only the rich and famous were guarantee of getting the best doctors with the best treatments and medications. I don&rsquo;t believe any country has a &lsquo;perfect healthcare system&rsquo; because we can always improve but I think that for improving we need to start having a public health perspective where prevention is key and we need to stop seeing healthcare only as a revenue where people are making profits out of other people sickness and ill-being. This means not only thinking healthcare for the individual patient but seeing a whole community as the patient.</span>
